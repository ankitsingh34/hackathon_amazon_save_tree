Hackathon 2022- Amazon Save Tree - Build Recycle Road

*Feature “Return Packaging”*

Problem Statement:

Every shopping done via Amazon uses one or other type of packaging, like Cardboard boxes, or Plastic or some other mean of packaging. The packaging material consumed per product might count negligible but global consumption of these material is very huge. Since Cardboard and Plastic both materials are reusable, we are proposing the feature on Amazon app to “Return Packaging” whether it is plastic or cardboard or wrapping papers in exchange of Reward points which customer can use during next shopping

Why is this feature important?

According to a report released by Sanford C. Bernstein, Amazon ships an average of 608 million packages / year, which equates to (an estimated) 1,600,000 packages a day which is equivalent to 10,000 trees per day and 3,650,000 trees per year in US. That’s a lot of cardboard, even when we consider some of the packaging used may be padded envelopes. High recycling numbers for the brown box doesn’t begin to address the larger issue: Each year in the United States, the paper thrown in the trash represents approximately 640 million trees, or roughly 915,000 acres of forest land, according to upstreampolicy.org (http://upstreampolicy.org/). 
On average, around 12 trees are required to make one ton of paper. So with recycled cardboard, over 3,150,000 trees are saved every year in the US to manufacture paper products. The growing trend of excessive packaging will certainly lead to considerable loss of forest cover, as wood pulp remains the main raw material for making packaging cardboard.

*Carbon emission :*

According to this (https://www.cartononduledefrance.org/en/eco-responsability/) , one ton of corrugated cardboard causes emissions amounting to 538 kg of CO2. In US, 1,600,000 packages are shipped per day which is equivalent to 588 ton of cardboard per day. It results in emission 316,344 kg of CO2 per day and 115,465,560 kg of CO2 per year which is a huge number. According to this (https://www.doncasterfreepress.co.uk/news/environment/how-much-carbon-dioxide-released-using-cardboard-and-plastic-packaging-1386548), 3 kg of CO2 emission is equivalent to burning of 1kg of oil. So, just because of cardboard , we are emitting CO2 equal to 38,488,520 kg of oil burning per year.

Why Cardboards ?


Cardboard boxes are the packaging products and also essential for protecting goods and products. These boxes are durable in nature so you can use them in house moves and removal. They offer protection to the items.

*Advantages of cardboard boxes:*

* *Made from renewable resources:* Cardboard boxes are made from paper pulp. This paper pulp is renewable because it is obtained from birch and pine trees.
* *Save energy:* Energy consumption in the manufacturing of these boxes is considerably less when compared to other packing materials.
* *Reusable:* These boxes can be used again and again. These boxes can be easily collapsed when not in use.
* *Easily disposable:* Recycled cardboard boxes are extremely nature friendly. They are easily disposable.
* *Lightweight:* They are very convenient to handle while packaging, loading and unloading.
* Paper pulp is the main material from which corrugated cardboard boxes are made. This pulp is obtained from birch and pine trees. The advantages of these trees are that they grow faster when compared to other varieties of hardwood trees.
* Cardboard boxes are recyclable in nature. The energy that is used in the manufacturing of these boxes is considerably less when compared to other packing materials. made with locally available materials, there is considerable reduction in the transportation costs. On the whole, the volume of energy spent in making corrugated cardboard boxes is considerably less.
*  Nature Friendly And Easily Disposable - Recycled cardboard boxes are extremely nature friendly and are easily disposable. They decompose easily and do not leave behind any kind of waste or toxic substances on the ground causing some kind of pollution. Throwing away the boxes in the recyclable bin is also an option of disposing off the packing materials successfully without affecting the environment.

Current Scenario 

* Amazon buys its packaging material from these companies.
    * WestRock
    * International Paper
    * PCA
    * Georgia Pacific
* Amazon use these packaging material/cardboard to ship products to the customer 
* Its on customer to recycle or not to recycle the cardboard
* If package gets recycled 
    * then it will go back to these companies and gets reused and amazon will buy again 
* if package does not get recycled 
    * then it gets wasted 

In both ways, if package gets recycled or not, amazon has to buy packages from these companies. What if , Amazon gets its package back ?

* Customer will be more inclined towards recycle/return packaging as he/she will get rewards point in exchange of this

Revenue of these companies just by selling cardboard and packaging materials

*WestRock:*

* WestRock revenue for the quarter ending March 31, 2022 was *$5.382B*, a *21.28% increase* year-over-year.
* WestRock revenue for the twelve months ending March 31, 2022 was *$20.241B*, a *15.35% increase* year-over-year.
* WestRock annual revenue for 2021 was *$18.746B*, a *6.64% increase* from 2020.

*International Paper:*

* International Paper revenue for the quarter ending June 30, 2022 was *$5.389B*, a *12.98% increase* year-over-year.
* International Paper revenue for the twelve months ending June 30, 2022 was *$20.626B*, a *23.44% increase* year-over-year.
* International Paper annual revenue for 2021 was *$19.363B*, a *10.24% increase* from 2020.

*Georgia Pacific:*

* Packaging Of America revenue for the quarter ending June 30, 2022 was *$2.237B*, a *19.01% increase* year-over-year.
* Packaging Of America revenue for the twelve months ending June 30, 2022 was *$8.417B*, a *18.63% increase* year-over-year.
* Packaging Of America annual revenue for 2021 was *$7.73B*, a *16.1% increase* from 2020.



What  are we proposing to solve this problem?

* The packaging material consumed per product might count negligible, but as per above statistic, global consumption of these material is very huge
* To save environment from plastic pollution or setting up the recycling process for cardboard can not happen at individual level. Giant organisations like Amazon can help us take steps forward and collectively help globe to setup appropriate process in place to protect Earth and all species from these calamities
* Since Cardboard and Plastic both materials are reusable, we are proposing the feature on Amazon app to “*Return Packaging*” whether it is plastic or cardboard or wrapping papers in exchange of Reward points which customer can use during next shopping
* This can help organise the re-usable packaging stuff in bulk for Amazon, and schedule their recycling process. It will account for big revolution in terms of organising packaging wastes and reusing the material for next cycles of delivery which can help save the environment and make contribution to improve the quality of life on planet Earth for all species

How Amazon can handle Return Packaging ?

Amazon can tie up with third party firms for recycling their collected cardboard in return of money or new cardboard. In this way Amazon can save the cost of buying new cardboard again and again. There are many firm like RecoverUSA , QuincyRecycle, GoLoadUp, International Paper, etc. which will even provide Logistic to collect the bulk of used cardboards and buy from them.

Conclusion :

Amazon, being the top customer concentric company, can take the initiative of introducing return package feature. All customers would love to return the used cardboards for some reward points or cash-back. It will not only save the cost of producing new cardboard but this feature will add Environment safety and Eco-Friendly delivery. This will be the first e-commerce company providing the feature who takes charge of the package recycling to save the Globe and Go-Green Campaign
